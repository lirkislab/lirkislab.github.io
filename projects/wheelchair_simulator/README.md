LIRKIS G-CVE project
=================

Wheelchair Simulator 3D using web-based virtual reality for remote training.

Patient pages are for people trying out the electric wheelchair. For a genuine experience, use Oculus Quest, because the simulator was developed for that virtual reality headset. 
The movement of the electric wheelchair is authentic in VR mode (use left controller thumbstick). Visitor pages are for people who are observing the patient.
